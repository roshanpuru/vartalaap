Ramanujan : Man who knew and can express infinity.

> “An equation for me has no meaning, unless it expresses a thought of God.”
> ― **Srinivasa Ramanujan**

We had eminnent scientists in the past which we choose to overlook where same has been celebrated in the west. Our school textbooks don't have any mention where in west there are named equation for them. Thanks to Historians, India killed one of these scientist called Ramanujan. Whether it was complex from west intellectuals or Ramanujan being Brahmin, India chose to undermine his contribution to Maths and Physics.

##### Ramanujan's appication to Physics:

```
.... Ramanujan's Mock Theta Function Mystery solved a century later ...
```

Ramanujan while sick and dying in India, mentioned some very peculiarly behaving functions which mimicked the original moldular functions.

The mock theta functions remained a mystery for most part of the last century and only the Great Ono made inroads towards their reality.

In fact, no one at the time understood what Ramanujan was talking about.

It wasn’t until 2002, through the work of Sander Zwegers, that we had a description of the functions that Ramanujan was writing about in 1920,' Ono said.

Ono and his colleagues drew on modern mathematical tools that had not been developed before Ramanujan’s death to prove this theory was correct.

Ramanujan actually wrote those functions claiming that he saw it in a scroll in the hands of A Goddess.

Anyway now they are used to calculate the entropy of Black Holes ( A concept which developed years after his death.)

Ono’s team was stunned to find the function could be used today.

'No one was talking about black holes back in the 1920s when Ramanujan first came up with mock modular forms, and yet, his work may unlock secrets about them,' Ono says.

His equations are widely used in study of BlackHoles, Quantum Mechanics and String Theory.



We made to belive to that ideals are bollywood actor and actress where world still belive in scientists. Time has come where we idealize people who really deserves it. Not some morons from boollywood.
